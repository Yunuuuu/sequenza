Changes in version 2.0.1 (2014-07-22)
 - Results model fitting plot using the B-allele/depth-ratio plot.
 - Present alternative solutions using local maximum of the CP plot.
 - Model the expected maximum B-allele frequency with a t-distribution using observed sd, rather then taking the 95% of the observed Bf.
 - Use dt instead of dbinom for the BAF and depth ratio model.
 - Fix documentation discrepancies on the sequenza-utils.py execution.
 - Add breaks as optional argument - enable to input custom segmentation - 
 - Add different segmentation data, fast, het and full, allowing different resolution option.
 - Minor fixes.

Changes in version 2.0.0 (2014-04-08)
 - Change seqz names header and some function arguments/formats to improve usability
 - Add to sequenza.fit a method argument to calculate cellularity and ploidy also from mutations
 - Change the recommended file extension from ".abfreq" to ".seqz" for clarity.
 - The "seqz" file now contains a column with strand orientation information.
 - "cp.plot" now plots the scaled log-likelihood.
 - "theoretical.depth.ratio" now implements the correct formula.
 - The "theoretical.*" functions have their arguments rearranged, and defaults changed, for consistency.
 - "sequenza.extract" now has additional filtering arguments.
 - Miscellaneous cleanup/simplification/optimization.

Changes in version 1.0.5 (2014-02-04)
 - Add a python utility for binning the data to a desired window size (reducing vastly memory footprint in the analysis)
 - Fix default workflows parameter to detect CN up to 20.

Changes in version 1.0.4 (2014-01-16)
 - Add function to import VarScan2 output
 - Add results function, to save results and standard plots.
 - Fix error on loading non-zipped files in the workflow.
 - Ignore error and finish the process if one of the chromosome fails in the workflows.

Changes in version 1.0.3 (2013-12-12)
 - Fix grep instructions that broke single chromosome loading
