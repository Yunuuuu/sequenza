\title{Import VarScan output files, for use with the Sequenza algorithm.}

\description{
   This function reads the output files from the \comman{somatic} and \command{copynumber} programs, which are part of VarScan version 2. The resulting object can be used, in lieu of a \dQuote{seqz} object, within Sequenza.
}

\usage{
  VarScan2seqz(varscan.somatic, varscan.copynumber = NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{varscan.somatic}{a data frame from the output file of \comman{somatic}.}
  \item{varscan.copynumber}{a data frame from the output file of \command{copynumber} (optional).}
}

\details{
  It is possible to run sequenza with the output of VarScan2 version 2.3.6. Earlier versions may also work but have not been tested.
}

\value{
A data frame with the seqz format, as returned by \code{\link{read.seqz}}.
